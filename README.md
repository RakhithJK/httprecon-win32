# httprecon

httprecon provides an open-source utility of enhanced web server fingerprinting. By using traditional and new techniques the provided httpd implementation can be detected which is very important for further enumeration and attacks. Some of these techniques were introduced in the book 'Die Kunst des Penetration Testing'. Furthermore, new fingerprints can be saved within the database and results exported into html reports.
